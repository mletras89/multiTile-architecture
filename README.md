# Modulo Scheduling Simulator for Multicore Architectures

This repository presents the implementation of a system level simulator.
Here, the simulation of an application to a many core architecture is performed.
The simulator takes as inputs the target architecture, the application and the scheduler.


## Project Compilation

To compile the project is required Java. Python is required for some scripts to visualize the output of the simulation e.g., showing the processor, crossbar and memory utilizations.<br>
To build the project, open a terminal and type:
```bash
make all
```
## Project Test
This repository also includes several test applications to check the correct functionality. To check the project run:<br>
```bash
make check_all
```
This will run all the tests and compare their outputs to preloaded golden cases.<br>
To visualize the output of a test application, the python folder includes two scripts: 1) **print-gantt-chart-runtime.py** and 2) **print-memory-utilization.py**.
The schedules presented here were generated using these scripts.

## Application
The application is defined as a dataflow graph. A dataflow graph consists of a collection of actors that are connected via communication channels.
In the context of this repository, the communication channels are implemented as First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffers.
Actors model the functionality of the application under observation.
E.g., the following figure presents the dataflow of an implementation of the sobel algorithm.

![Application Graph](img/DFG.png)

To define a application graph, you can declare an actor using the **Actor** class as:

```c
Actor a1 = new Actor("a1");
a1.setExecutionTime(10000);
a1.setInputs(0); 
a1.setOutputs(1); 
```

It is required to specify the execution time of a given actor used during scheduling and simulation. Also, the number of input and output ports are required. In the example, **a1** has no inputs and has one output port.

The definition of communication channels as FIFOs can be done using the FIFO class:
```c
public Fifo(String name, int tokens, int capacity, int tokenSize,
            Memory mapping,int consRate, int prodRate, Actor src, 
            Actor dst)
Fifo c1 = new Fifo("c1",0,1,1000000,memory1,1,1,a1,a2); 
```

The relation between FIFOs and Actors is specified by the actor's methods **setOutputFifos** and **setInputFifos**.
E.g., in the following listing, the actor **a1** has one output connected to FIFO **c1**, whereas the actor **a2** has one input connected to the FIFO **c1**. Actors **a1** and **a2** communicate via channel **c1**.

```c
Vector<Fifo> v1 = new Vector<Fifo>();
v1.addElement(c1);
a1.setOutputFifos(v1);

Vector<Fifo> v2 = new Vector<Fifo>();
v2.addElement(new Fifo(c1));
a2.setInputFifos(v2);
```

You must use the class **Application** to define an application as follows:

```c
Application sampleApplication = new Application();
sampleApplication.setActorsFromList(actors);
sampleApplication.setFifos(fifoMap);
```

Here, it is required to pass the actors and the FIFOS that composed the application after constructing the application itself.


## Target Architecture

The second part of the input specification is the definition of the target architecture.
In the context of this repository, we consider two target architectures 1) Symmetric Quad-Core Architecture and 2) Multi-tile Many-cores architecture. 
E.g., the following figure presents the Symmetric Quad-Core target architecture.
Each processor has a local scratchpad memory, and its turn each processor is connected to a bus which also connects a global memory. Here, the global memory is used to communicate the different processors.

For creating a symmetric multicore architecture, you must use the following constructor:

```c
public Architecture(String name, String nameTile, int nProcPerTile, 
                    double BWCrossbars, int channelsCrossbar)

Architecture singleCoreArchitecture = new Architecture("architecture","Tile1", 4, 1.0, 2);
```

The previous listing declares a architecture name "architecure" with a tile named "Tile1", with four processors with a crossbar interconnect with two channels at 1.0 Gbps.
The crossbar also connects the four cores to the global memory as in the next figure.

![Target Architecture overview](img/targetQuadCore.png)

### Processor 

When declaring an architecture and specifying the number of processors, the corresponding processors are declared in the constructor of the tile  as:

```c
this.numberProcessors = numberProcessors;
this.processors = new HashMap<>();
//System.out.println("Here!");
for(int i=0; i<this.numberProcessors;i++){
  Processor processor = new Processor(this.name+"_Processor"+i);
  processor.setOwnerTile(this);
  processors.put(processor.getId(),processor);
}
```

When declaring a processor, the name of the processor is required in the constructor, however, during the construction of a processor the scratchpad local memory is created and connected to the processor.

```c
public Processor(String name) {
    this.setName(name);
    this.setId(ArchitectureManagement.getProcessorId());
    localMemory = new LocalMemory(this.name+"_localMemory");
    // connecting local memory to processor
    this.localMemory.setEmbeddedToProcessor(this);
  }
```

### Memory 
An important element of the architecture is the memory. There might be three types of memories:

```c
public static enum MEMORY_TYPE {
  LOCAL_MEM,
  TILE_LOCAL_MEM,
  GLOBAL_MEM
}
```

The scratchpad memory (LOCAL_MEM) has been already introduced as a member of a processor. Further details about the other memories will be given in next sections.
An important feature of this simulator is the flexibility of simulate without memory constraints (assuming memory boundless just for simulation purposes). If a memory size constraint is violated the memory will notify this situation and memory relocation strategies might be also implemented. During the construction, all memories are set capacity to **Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY** however the capacity can be changed via the method **setCapacity(double capacity)**.

```c
  public Memory(String name){
    this.name = name;
    this.id       = ArchitectureManagement.getMemoryId();
    this.resetMemoryUtilization();
    this.capacity = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
  }
```


Also, the memory tracks the number of bytes stored in memory at any simulation time **private Map<Double,Double> memoryUtilization**. The next figure, shows the output of a memory trace during simulation.
![Memory Utilization Example](img/memUtilEx.png)
Memory might be read and written along simulation. The memory capacity must be specified in terms of bytes.

### Crossbar

The crossbar is the element used to connect the processors in a tile. The crossbar is defined as follows:
```c
public Crossbar(String name, double bandwidth, int numberofParallelChannels)
```

The crossbar tracks the transfers of data of any processor to the tile local memory placed in each tile.
```c
private List<LinkedList<Transfer>> scheduledActions;
private Map<Actor,List<Transfer>> scheduledReadTransfers;
private Map<Actor,List<Transfer>> scheduledWriteTransfers;
```
A transfer can be categorized as **READ** or **WRITE**.
```c
public static enum TRANSFER_TYPE {
          READ,
          WRITE
  }
```
The elements stored in a TRANSFER are:
```c
public class Transfer {
  private double start_time;
  private double due_time;
  // in a transfer, an actor and a Fifo are involved
  private Actor actor;
  private Fifo fifo;
  // depending on the type of the operation: {READ, WRITE}
  private TRANSFER_TYPE type;
```
Here, the elements involved are an actor that reads or writes to a given FIFO. The **start_time** of the Transfer must be specified. The length of the transfer is calculated using the number of tokens produced/consumed by the actor and the bandwidth of the crossbar used to perform the transfer.

### Tile
The class that glues of the previous presented elements is the class Tile.
A tile is composed of a collection of processors, a crossbar and a tile local memory.
```c
public class Tile{
  private int id;
  private String name;
  private int numberProcessors;
  // the key is the id
  private HashMap<Integer,Processor> processors;
  private Crossbar crossbar;
  private TileLocalMemory tileLocalMemory;
...
```
The declarion of a tile is as follows:
```c
// creaate one tile in the architecture
Tile t1 = new Tile("Tile1",4,1.0,2);
```
The previous declared a tile named "Tile1" with 4 processors and a crossbar with 2 channels at 1.0 Gbps.
### Multi-tile Architecture
The class architecture offers the flexibility to declare multi-tile architectures.
The trivial case is single tile architecture as already presented. However, non-symmetric architectures might also be able to define as in the following figure.
![Target Architecture overview](img/targetArch.png)
The basic elements of the architecture class are:
```c
public class Architecture{
  // the key is the id
  private String name;
  private HashMap<Integer,Tile> tiles;
  //private NoC noc;
  private GlobalMemory globalMemory;
```
In the architecture class, a collection of tiles communicates to a Global Memory connected via a Network-on-Chip (NoC).
The already presented multi-tile architecture can be defined as:
```c
public Architecture(String name, int nTiles, int nProcPerTile, 
                    double BWCrossbars, int channelsCrossbar)

Architecture architecture = new Architecture("architecture",3, 4, 1.0, 2);
```
### Network-on-Chip

Work in Progress

## Mapping Definition

It is possible to define two types of mappings: <br>
* Mapping of actors to processors

![Mapping of actors to processors](img/actorMapping.png)

Any actor might be mapped to any processor in the architecture. The following shows how to bind an actor to a processor.

```c
a1.setMapping(cpu1);
a1.setMappingToTile(t1); 
```

* Mapping of communication channels to memories

![Mapping of communication channels](img/channelMapping.png)

In principle, any communication channel can be mapped to any memory in the architecture. However, make no sense to put a communication channel to a scratchpad memory that has no relation with the producer or consumer processor. Accordingly, the memory mapping is constraint as:

```c
public static enum FIFO_MAPPING_TYPE {
  SOURCE,
  DESTINATION,
  TILE_LOCAL,
  GLOBAL
}
```                      

Then, a communication channel can be mapped to the global memory, the tile local memory or to the scratchpad local memory belonging to the consumer or producer processor.

## Modulo Scheduling
To implement the scheduling of a given application to a give architecture, we need to use the class **ModuloScheduler** specifying the application and the architecture.
```c
ModuloScheduler scheduler = new ModuloScheduler();
scheduler.setApplication(app);
scheduler.setArchitecture(architecture);
```
On top of the application and the architecture, it is required to specify the maximum number of iterations, as default is 5. 
```c
scheduler.setMaxIterations(5);
scheduler.calculateModuloSchedule();
//scheduler.printKernelBody();
scheduler.findSchedule();
scheduler.schedule();
```
Calling the function **scheduler.calculateModuloSchedule()** calculates the modulo schedule of the given application on the target architecture as presented in:

[1] Kejariwal, A., Nicolau, A. (2011). **Modulo Scheduling and Loop Pipelining.** 
In: Padua, D. (eds) Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing. 
Springer, Boston, MA. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-09766-4_65
![Modulo scheduling example](img/imageModulo1.png)

E.g., the previous figure presents an example of the modulo scheduling. a) An input application.
b) The available resources to run the application (1 adder and 1 multiplier). c) The data dependency graph obtained from a), in the context of this repository a DDG match to the concept of Dataflow graph.
The modulo schedule determines the Minimum Initialization Interval of a given application. That means that overlapping iterations can start every MII period.<br>
![Modulo scheduling example](img/modulosSchedule2.png)

d) Presents a feasible modulo schedule with an MII=2. e) Presents an infeasible schedule with MII=1, here we can observe that in the third control step, we have v3 and v2 at the same time. This situation is infeasible due that there is only one multiplier in the architecture.

The next figure presents the output of modulo scheduling the sobel application to single core, dual core and quad core architectures.

#### Modulo Scheduling for quad core implementation of sobel
![Quad core Modulo scheduling example](img/moduloQuadCore.png)

### Memory Relocation Strategy

In case a memory constraint exists, first the memory has to be constraint as follows (the method receives an integer number describing the number of stored bytes in the memory):
```c
Architecture architecture = new Architecture("architecture","MemoryRelocation", 4, 1.0, 2);
// set the memory sizes
architecture.getTiles().get(0).getProcessors().get(0).getLocalMemory().setCapacity(1000000);
architecture.getTiles().get(0).getProcessors().get(1).getLocalMemory().setCapacity(1000000);
architecture.getTiles().get(0).getProcessors().get(2).getLocalMemory().setCapacity(1000000);
architecture.getTiles().get(0).getProcessors().get(3).getLocalMemory().setCapacity(2000000);
```
To perform the memory relocation strategy, the following replace strategy is performed:<br>
* LOCAL_MEMORY -> TILE_LOCAL_MEMORY <br>
* TILE_LOCAL_MEMORY -> GLOBAL_MEMORY <br>

For instance, if a communication channel **c** is mapped to a local memory **SPM1** and during simulation there is no available space to place **c** into **SPM1**. <br>
Then, the communication channel **c** is relocated to its tile local memory **TMEM1**. If **TMEM1** is not sufficient to allocate **c**, then the communication channel **c** is placed onto the GLOBAL_MEMORY. Here, we assume to have enough space in the global memory to store any communication channel.

![Schedule Memory Relocation example](img/memRelocation.png)

The next figure shows the memory utilization of the four local memories and the global local memory.
The mappings are:

```c
// Mappings of actors to cpus 
a1.setMapping(cpu1);
a2.setMapping(cpu2); 
a3.setMapping(cpu3);  
a4.setMapping(cpu3);
// Mappings of fifos to local memory of cpus
// channels connected to writer
Fifo c1 = new Fifo("c1",0,1,1000000,1,1,a1,a2,FIFO_MAPPING_TYPE.SOURCE);  
Fifo c2 = new Fifo("c2",0,1,1000000,1,1,a2,a3,FIFO_MAPPING_TYPE.SOURCE);  
Fifo c3 = new Fifo("c3",0,1,1000000,1,1,a2,a4,FIFO_MAPPING_TYPE.SOURCE);  
Fifo c4 = new Fifo("c4",0,1,1000000,1,1,a3,a5,FIFO_MAPPING_TYPE.SOURCE);  
Fifo c5 = new Fifo("c5",0,1,1000000,1,1,a4,a5,FIFO_MAPPING_TYPE.SOURCE);  
```
Here, all local memory can store up to 1000000 bytes, however FIFOs **c2** and **c3** are mapped to the local scratchpad memory placed in **cpu2** which can only store 1000000 bytes.
The following figure presents the memory utilization of the feasible schedule previously presented.
Note that a communication channel was relocated to the TILE_LOCAL_MEMORY.

![Memory Utilization of Memory Relocation example](img/memoryUtilRelocation.png)

## Memory Footprint Reduction of Multicast Actors

Multicast actors are dummy actors that replicate the input data to their outputs.
These kind of operations are required in many signal processing applications.
The memory footprint of an application can be calculated as:

![Memory footprint of multicast actors](img/memOverhead.png)

From the previous, we can observe that there exists a memory footprint overhead induced by the multicast actor.
We replace a multicast actors and the channels connected to it by a **Multi-Reader Buffer (MRB)**.
By including MRBs instead of multicast actors, a memory footprint can be induces as follows:

![Replacement of multicast actors](img/memReduction.png)

The semantics of an MRB in brief are, that a token in the buffer can not be flushed until all the readers actors read it.
In consequence, we are trading the memory footprint saved by MRBs at the expense of scheduling overhead.

The way to declare a multicast actor is as follows:
```c
Actor a2 = new Actor("a2");  // is a multicast actor                                     
a2.setExecutionTime(10000);                                                              
a2.setInputs(1);                                                                         
a2.setOutputs(2);                                                                        
a2.setMapping(cpu1);                                                                     
a2.setType(Actor.ACTOR_TYPE.MULTICAST);                                                  
```

The class **ApplicationManagement** provides the following methods for 1) set all the multicast as mergeable and 2) for replacing the multicast actor by a MRB.
```c
public static void setAllMulticastActorsAsMergeable(Application app)

public static void collapseMergeableMulticastActors(Application app)
```                                                                                      

The following schedules the example sobel application as it is (the multicast actor is not replaced)

![Before MRB](img/beforeMRB.png)

Whereas, the following schedule is obtained after replacing the multicast actor **a2** by a MRB.

![After MRB](img/afterMRB.png)

You can observe, that in this case, the replacing of the multicast by an MRB delivers an application with better performance. This might not be the case always.
