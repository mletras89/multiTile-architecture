# Multi-tile Architecture Simulator

This repository presents the implementation of a system level simulator.
Here, the simulation of an application to a many core architecture is performed.
The simulator takes as inputs the target architecture, the application and the scheduler.


# Application
The application is defined as a dataflow graph.
